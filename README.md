# powerAutomateOldDesign
This is a chrome extension that allows for switching of the URL from "v3=true" to "v3=false" to always display the old designer whenever a link is opened that contains "v3=". I just prefer the old designer. Nothing more, nothing less (except a cute dog as extension thumbnail).
